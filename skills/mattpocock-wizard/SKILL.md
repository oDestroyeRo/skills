description: Generate an interactive bash wizard that walks a human through steps only they can perform. Use when provisioning infrastructure, setting up credentials or CI secrets, walking an unfamiliar third-party dashboard, or running a one-off migration or cutover. Don't invoke this for steps the agent can perform itself.

Read the complete [upstream skill](source/SKILL.md) before doing the task.

Resolve `source/SKILL.md` to its real path. Resolve the workflow's relative file references from that upstream file, so its scripts, references, and sibling skills stay together.

When it names another skill from this collection, use `mattpocock-<name>` or read that skill directly in [the upstream library](library). Keep this collection's skills together when names overlap with another collection.

For harness-specific tools, delegation, models, or settings, read the [harness adapter](harness.md) and apply the section for the current harness.
